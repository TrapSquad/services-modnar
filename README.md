## This fork: details

the elemental-ircd protomod is designed to work with ircd-modnar, not elemental.
the bahamut module is designed to work with ircd-rainbow-trout, not plain bahamut.
other than that, this is pretty much the same as standard Shalture. just with less lameness
regarding numeric channels

## Shaltúre

Shaltúre is a set of services for IRC networks designed for large IRC networks 
with high scalability requirements.  It is relatively mature software, with 
some code and design derived from another package called Shrike, and is a fork 
of a dying services package named Atheme.

Shaltúre's behavior is tunable using modules and a highly detailed 
configuration file. Almost all behavior can be changed at deployment time just 
by editing the configuration.

If you are running this code from Git, you should read `GIT-Access` for 
instructions on how to fully check out the Shaltúre tree, as it is spread 
across a few repositories.

## Building

Whatever you do, make sure you do *not* install Shaltúre into the same location 
as the source. Shaltúre will default to installing in `$HOME/shalture`, so make 
sure you plan accordingly for this.

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If you're still lost, read [INSTALL](INSTALL) or [GIT-Access](GIT-Access) for 
hints.
